          The New England Death Metal Fun Time Bonanza is New England’s premier
          festival for all things death metal. Not only do we feature tons of
          regional death metal bands, we also invite all kinds of vendors,
          artists, and all types of entertainers from the New England area. It
          is a truly wonderful festival that has built a great community around
          it. After a majorly successful fest in 2023, we are extremely stoked
          to show you what’s in store!

          Just like in 2023, the 2024 Bonanza will be held at The Five/Nine in
          Litchfield, New Hampshire. You aren’t going to find much on it aside
          from on facebook or instagram, however here is all the info you need.
          The Five/Nine is a house. Does that make the Bonanza a “house show”? I
          don’t know, I guess technically, but this ain’t no house show you’ve
          ever been to. The Bonanza is a full fledged death metal festival just
          like any other you would go to. We work our asses off to make sure our
          stages, facilities, staff, vendors, food, etc. are to the same
          standard as any major festival. In 2024, the Bonanza will have 2
          stages. The basement, or “dungeon” stage, is the heart of the
          Five/Nine and where all the most violent sets go down. Last year, the
          entire festival took place on the basement stage. This year we are
          introducing a state-of-the-art outdoor stage, because everything this
          year is going to be BIGGER!!!!! So big that we had to add an extra
          day!! We are also expanding our camping space to fit more tents, more
          porta potties, everything. Believe me when I say 2024 will be HUGE.
